# 👽🌍 Greetings, Earthlings! I'm Sai Krishna 👋

> "Half Human, Half Machine Learning... 100% Data Driven."

I'm a **Senior Data Scientist at Asian Institute of Gastroenterology **, sent from a galaxy far away to help Earth solve its most perplexing problems using **Computer Vision** 👁️ and **Natural Language Processing** 🧠 (I speak human AND machine!).

🛸 My previous assignment was with Capgemini, where I decoded the mysterious world of **insurance domain for fortune500 comapanies** and built models that (almost) predicted the future and risk compliance.

## 🛠️ My Earth Mission

- 🤖 Build super-smart ML models that make humans go, "Whoa!"
- 📷 Teach machines how to see (a.k.a. **Computer Vision**)
- 📜 Teach machines how to read and understand (a.k.a. **NLP**)
- 🧩 Solve puzzles that confuse both humans and CPUs

## 🧬 Currently Upgrading My Systems

- **Temporal Prediction**: Mastering time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and other timey-wimey stuff
- **Clinical NLP**: Helping doctors talk to machines (and vice versa)
- **Medical Imaging**: Making machines squint at X-rays like seasoned radiologists
- **MLOps**: Automating the pipeline so I can take more coffee breaks ☕

## 🤝 Galactic Collaborations Welcome

I'm looking to team up with:
- Rebels building open-source CV/NLP tools 👨‍💻👩‍💻
- Earthlings applying AI to insurance, finance, or healthcare 🏥
- Multimodal wizards who speak image, text, sound, and emoji 🪄

**Fun Fact:** My models train faster when there's good coffee and bad puns nearby.  
Let's make the universe (or at least Earth) a little smarter together. 🧠🌌

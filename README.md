# 👽🌍 Greetings, Earthlings! I'm Sai Krishna 👋

> "Half Human, Half Machine Learning... 100% Data Driven."

I'm a **Senior Data Scientist at Asian Institute of Gastroenterology**, sent from a galaxy far away to help Earth solve its most perplexing problems using **Computer Vision** 👁️ and **Natural Language Processing** 🧠 (I speak human AND machine!).

🛸 My previous assignment was with Capgemini, where I decoded the mysterious world of the **insurance domain for Fortune 500 companies** and built models that (almost) predicted the future and risk compliance.

## 🛠️ My Earth Mission

My primary directives involve:

- 🤖 Building super-smart ML models that make humans go, "Whoa!"
- 📷 Teaching machines how to **see** (a.k.a. Computer Vision applications).
- 📜 Enabling machines to **read and understand** human language (a.k.a. Natural Language Processing).
- 🧩 Solving complex data puzzles that challenge both carbon and silicon-based intelligence.

## 🧬 Currently Upgrading My Systems With

My ongoing research and development includes:

- **Temporal Prediction**: Mastering time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and other timey-wimey data phenomena.
- **Clinical NLP**: Enhancing doctor-machine communication and extracting insights from medical narratives.
- **Medical Imaging**: Training AI to interpret X-rays and other medical scans with expert-level precision.
- **Advanced MLOps**: Automating the AI lifecycle for more efficient deployments (and yes, more coffee breaks ☕).

## 🤝 Galactic Collaborations Welcome

I'm always on the lookout to team up with:

- **Open Source Rebels**: Innovators building next-gen CV/NLP tools 👨‍💻👩‍💻.
- **Domain Experts**: Earthlings applying AI to insurance, finance, or healthcare 🏥.
- **Multimodal Maestros**: Wizards fluent in image, text, sound, and perhaps even emoji-speak 🪄.
